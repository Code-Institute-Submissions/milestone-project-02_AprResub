# Milestone Project 02: Interactive Frontend Development
## Royal Touristz - Travel Website

[View the live project here.](https://atiqbeenrahim.github.io/milestone-project-02/)

This is the Interactive Frontend Development project for Full Stack Software Developement course. I decided to make travel website because it has more scope to use JavaScript. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential visitors and customers.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about service.
        2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. I want to look for the information and details of the company that it is experienced and trusted. I also want to locate company's social media links to see it's followings on social media to determine how trusted and known this company is.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. I want to find information to contact with the company for information and services.
        2. I want find the location of it's offices in the google map.
        3. I want to find filights information from this websites directly.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

        1. I want to check to see if there is any newly added services or offers has announced.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are pink and purple (#f64c72 and #242582).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Playfair Display font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Playfair Display is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. In the Hero section, I use video clip to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic. It will help me to promote my brand image and increase the trust of the customers.
